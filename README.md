## 💭 Intro:
In 2022, distracted driving claimed the lives of **3,308** people. steersafe is designed to combat this issue by offering a seamless mobile experience that rewards users for maintaining distraction-free driving habits. By detecting phone usage while driving and tracking driving hours, steersafe encourages drivers to keep their hands off their devices while earning points and rewards.

What sets steersafe apart is its **gentle, rewarding, and gamified approach**—unlike other apps that provide harsh grades and feedback, which discourage use, and lead to continued distracted driving. steersafe offers **easy-to-get incentives**, such as gift cards to Dunkin', and eventually partnerships with brands like Starbucks, where we imagine challenges such as "five safe drives in a row can earn users a free drink". steersafe also features a **leaderboard and friend system**, fostering friendly competition to see who can be the safest driver on the road.

## 🔑 Key Features:
- 🚗 **Real-time phone usage detection**: Utilizes accelerometer data to detect phone usage while driving.
- 🎯 **Gamified experience**: Earn points for distraction-free drives and redeem them for rewards like gift cards.
- 🏆 **Compete with friends**: View how you rank against others in your network on the leaderboard.
- 📊 **Track driving stats**: Monitor your driving time, tokens earned, and trips completed.

## 💻 Tech Stack:
- Frontend: Swift + SwiftUI
- Backend: Firebase
- Database: Firebase Realtime Database
- APIs: Apple CoreMotion, Apple CoreLocation, TomTom Map Data, Firebase User Authentication

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap
- [ ] Integrate new reward partnerships (e.g., Starbucks, Amazon).
- [ ] Get an Apple Developer License for more access to phone data to improve phone usage monitoring
