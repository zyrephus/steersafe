## 💭 Intro:
In 2022, distracted driving claimed the lives of 3,108 people. SteerSafe is designed to combat this issue by offering a seamless mobile experience that rewards users for maintaining distraction-free driving habits. By detecting phone usage while driving and tracking driving hours, SteerSafe encourages drivers to keep their hands off their devices while earning points and rewards.

What sets SteerSafe apart is its gentle, rewarding, and gamified approach—unlike other apps that provide harsh grades and feedback, which discourage use, and lead to continued distracted driving. SteerSafe offers easy-to-get incentives, such as gift cards to Dunkin', and eventually partnerships with brands like Starbucks, where we imagine challenges such as "five safe drives in a row can earn users a free drink". SteerSafe also features a leaderboard and friend system, fostering friendly competition to see who can be the safest driver on the road.

## 🔑 Key Features:
- 🚗 **Real-time phone usage detection**: Utilizes accelerometer data to detect phone usage while driving.
